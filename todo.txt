(General)
- Extend size of content area (as indicated by red line) to 819 px on wide-enough screens. Single-column content will sit to the left, with a gap separating it from the step list, and multi-column content will fill the space

- Right-align regular text in big buttons
- Maintain a 15px padding inside big buttons
- Align the radio button inside a big button with the title
- Ensure big buttons have a minimum height of 135px, including the 5px blue border when selected
- Add numbered section headings to step navigation

020 What type of business are you incorporating?
- Ensure the "Basic incorporation" and "Custom incorporation" big buttons have a minimum width of 240px, and the "Not-for-profit incorporation" big button has a minimum width of 280px
- Line up the top of the dividing line with the top of the headings ("Business corporation", "Not-for-profit corporation")

090 Distinctive words in your name proposal
- If we can't fit all the capsules on one line, then stack terms and use checkboxes instead (ref. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6284600/display-a-div-only-if-there-is-enough-space-and-hide-it-if-there-isnt)

100 Are other businesses using your proposed name?
- Add a column title for the checkboxes so we don't have to repeat the label on each line
- Condense the list items vertically
- Add expand/collapse all

140 Paying for an evaluation of your proposed name
- Add note that this page (and the one following) belong at the end of the process, not here. TRACY to propose wording

160 Your payment was successful
- We discussed a variety of fixes for the alert at the bottom and decided that the real solution was to move this payment process, like the contact information page, to the end of the entire process
