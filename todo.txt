(General)
- Extend size of content area (as indicated by red line) to 819 px on wide-enough screens. Single-column content will sit to the left, with a gap separating it from the step list, and multi-column content will fill the space

- Right-align regular text in big buttons
- Maintain a 15px padding inside big buttons
- Align the radio button inside a big button with the title
- Ensure big buttons have a minimum height of 135px, including the 5px blue border when selected
- Add numbered section headings to step navigation

020 What type of business are you incorporating?
- Ensure the "Basic incorporation" and "Custom incorporation" big buttons have a minimum width of 240px, and the "Not-for-profit incorporation" big button has a minimum width of 280px
- Line up the top of the dividing line with the top of the headings ("Business corporation", "Not-for-profit corporation")

090 Distinctive words in your name proposal
- Ensure capsules have a minimum width so they aren't just circles
- Fix the capsules so that the underline appears on hover/active and the filled background on selection, rather than the other way round as at present
- Increase the length of the underline on wider capsules
- If we can't fit all the capsules on one line, then stack terms and use checkboxes instead (ref. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6284600/display-a-div-only-if-there-is-enough-space-and-hide-it-if-there-isnt)

095 Distinctive words in your name proposal [two-name version]
- Note that if one of the languages only has a single term other than the legal element then we include it on the page but pre-check the term. If both languages only have a single term other than the legal element then we skip the page as in the one-name version

100 Are other businesses using your proposed name?
- Add a column title for the checkboxes so we don't have to repeat the label on each line
- Condense the list items vertically
- For trademarks, replace "Nice classification codes" with "Business activity (Nice classification)"
- Add expand/collapse all

110 Upload supporting documents
- Make the information that documents must be in unlocked PDF format and may be up to 10MB in size more prominent

120 Finalizing your name proposal
- Add space below "Choose any underlined statement that you would like to edit" (the "ask")

150 Paying for an evaluation of your proposed name
- Replace "CVD" with "Security code"
- Something we forgot from last week: change "Next" button to yellow per existing Corporations Canada design
- Add note that this page (and the one following) belong at the end of the process, not here. TRACY to propose wording

160 Your payment was successful
- We discussed a variety of fixes for the alert at the bottom and decided that the real solution was to move this payment process, like the contact information page, to the end of the entire process
