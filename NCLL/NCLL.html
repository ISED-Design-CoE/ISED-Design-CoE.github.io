<p>ISED has designed a non-competitive local licensing (NCLL) process to provide a simple licensing approach to allow small operators and businesses easy access to 5G wireless services and beyond.</p>

<h2>Why choose NCLL?</h2>

<p>An NCLL framework will promote the growth of innovative business models, encourage continuous investment in cutting-edge wireless technology like 5G networks, and enhance connectivity in Canada. NCLL can prove advantageous for local entrepreneurs and small wireless service operators.</p>

<p>The licence area for the wireless service can accommodate custom shapes and sizes to support areas as small as a single farm, factory, university campus, or a rural community.</p>

<h3>Renewable (Option to renew annually)</h3>

<p>Renewable licences can be renewed annually as long as the <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/spectrum-allocation/decision-non-competitive-local-licensing-framework-including-spectrum-3900-3980-mhz-band-and#sB">licence conditions</a> are met.</p>

<h3>Temporary (1 day to 11 months)</h3>

<p>Temporary licences are available for periods between 1 day and 11 months.</p>

<h2 id="Deployment requirements">Deployment requirements</h2>

<p>ISED aims to ensure that spectrum is actually used, and is not warehoused or resold. Any spectrum that is not used will be made available to others.</p>

<p>As a licensee, you have two years to deploy at least one station and begin operating your network.</p>

<p>You will need to demonstrate to ISED that you’re covering your licence area on an ongoing basis by uploading your site data. You must start uploading site data within one month of receiving your licence, and continue doing so on a monthly basis. If you haven’t deployed any stations yet, see instructions <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-system/en/spectrum-management-system-data/faq-spectrum-licence-site-data-upload#q15">What if I haven’t deployed any stations or am decommissioning stations at the time that my monthly report is due?</a></p>

<h2 id="No leasing or trading">No leasing or trading</h2>

<p>An non-competitive local (NCL) licence is only to be used by the licensee. It is not transferable in whole or in part and cannot be leased, traded, sub-divided or subordinated in frequencies or geographic areas.</p>

<h2 id="Use the NCLL spectrum browser to help plan your licence">Use the NCLL spectrum browser to help plan your licence</h2>

<p>The NCLL spectrum browser is an online tool that allows you to search for existing NCL licences and other radio services in your desired areas. This spectrum browser can be a valuable tool for planning and can also generate your coordinates in WKT format, which can be easily copied directly into the licence application form.</p>

<p>Note that commercial mobile wireless services may be operating in the in the vicinity of NCL licensees. Any NCLL operations on block A1 (3900-3910 MHz) won’t be protected from commercial mobile wireless operations, nor may they impact them.</p>

<h4>Bandwidth</h4>

<p>NCL licences in the 3900 MHz band have two options for bandwidth:</p>

<ul>
	<li>10 MHz</li>
	<li>20 MHz (i.e. two contiguous 10 MHz blocks)</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a user is assigned one block, such as Block A2: 3910-3920 MHz, they will have 10 MHz of bandwidth.</li>
	<li>If a user is assigned two contiguous blocks, such as Blocks A5 and A6: 3940-3960 MHz, they will have 20 MHz of contiguous bandwidth.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also possible to apply for two non-adjacent 10 MHz blocks, in two separate applications. For example, a user can apply separately for Block A3 (3920-3930 MHz) and Block A7 (3960-3970 MHz).</p>

<p>NCL licensees in the 3900 MHz band may not have a total of more than 20 MHz in any location.</p>

<h4>Licence types</h4>

<p>The 3900 MHz band offers two licence types, low power and medium power. A low power licence might be ideal for industrial and enterprise applications, particularly for localized or indoor activities. On the other hand, a medium power licence could be more appropriate to service larger outdoor areas.</p>

<div class="clearfix"> </div>
 

<p>The area types correspond to one of four categories within the Tier 5 service areas.  For more information, refer to <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/spectrum-allocation/service-areas-competitive-licensing">Service areas for competitive licensing</a> or refer to the NCLL spectrum browser found on the <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-system/en/NCL">NCLL services page</a>.</p>

<p>Licensees can establish a mix of indoor and outdoor stations for both Low power and Medium power licence types. SRSP-521, <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/devices-and-equipment/standard-radio-system-plans/srsp-521"><cite>Technical Requirements for Non-Competitive Local Licensed Services, including Fixed and/or Mobile Systems, and Flexible Use Broadband Systems, in the Band 3900-3980 MHz</cite></a>, specifies the technical requirements for NCLL in the 3900 MHz band. The maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) indicates the system total transmit output power effectively radiated by the transmission antenna in a specific direction. Licensees intending to operate exclusively indoors need a low power type licence. Indoor operations have EIRP that is limited to 1 watt per 10-MHz frequency block, or 2 watts per 20-MHz block.</p>

<p>In metro and urban areas, the EIRP is limited to 1 watt per 10-MHz frequency block, or 2 watts per 20-MHz, with an antenna height limit of 10 m.</p>

<p>In rural and remote areas there can be one of the following two options for EIRP and antenna height:</p>

<ol>
	<li>same technical limits as for metro and urban areas</li>
	<li>EIRP of 50 watts per 10 MHz frequency block, or 100 watts for 20 MHz, with antenna height limit of 50 m</li>
</ol>

<p>You can apply for multiple licences to cover larger areas.</p>

<p>To learn more about this band, visit the <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/node/2247">3900 MHz Band</a> page.</p>

<h4>A focus on local users</h4>

<p>NCLL isn’t just another band for commercial telcos. It’s designed to be used by businesses, by underserved remote communities, and by all Canadians. Some of the restrictions that are in place to support that use in the 3900 MHz band are as follows:</p>

<p><b>An area size cap per licence type: </b> A low power licence type can have an area of no more than 15 km<sup>2</sup> and a medium power licence type can have an area between 75 and 165 km<sup>2</sup>. In order to reduce interference and increase the number of potential licences, only low power licences are allowed in urban and metro areas.</p>

<p><b>A spectrum cap:</b> At any given location, a single licensee can have no more than 20 MHz of NCLL spectrum, even if they have multiple overlapping licences.</p>

<p><b>Reserved spectrum that isn’t available to large telecom providers:</b></p>

<p>Any entity, or affiliate of that entity (as defined in section 6.2 of the <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/spectrum-allocation/decision-non-competitive-local-licensing-framework-including-spectrum-3900-3980-mhz-band-and#s6"><cite>Decision on a Non-Competitive Local Licensing Framework, Including Spectrum in the 3900-3980 MHz Band and Portions of the 26, 28 and 38 GHz Bands</cite></a>), with 100,000 or more retail mobile wireless phone subscribers is ineligible to hold a licence for the blocks from 3940 MHz to 3980 MHz.</p>
<a id="tab2-content-LicenceFees"> </a>

<h4>Licence fees</h4>

<p>NCLL has affordable licence fees that encourage innovative use and applications.</p>

<p>The annual licence fee is calculated by the following equation:</p>

<p>Annual base rate for area type × total bandwidth (MHz) × area size (km<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<!--TABLE 2-->

			<td>$0.45</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Remote</b></td>
			<td>$0.01</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p> </p>

<p>There is a minimum annual fee of $48.00 (2024 amount) for all NCL licences, which is subject to be adjusted annually in accordance with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Please refer to <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/spectrum-and-telecommunications-fees">Spectrum and telecommunication fees</a> for complete information about the licence fees for NCLL.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>For renewable licences authorized during the course of a fiscal year, or for non-renewable short-term licences authorized for durations of less than one year, ISED will apply a prorated fee of 1/12th of the total annual fee for each calendar month (in whole or in part). The minimum monthly fee is $4.00.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="General">Is 3900 MHz a 5G band?</h2>
</summary>

<p>Yes, the 3900 MHz band is a 5G band.</p>

<p>The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has identified a 5G frequency band that covers the 3900-3980 MHz (i.e. n77), resulting in access to an equipment ecosystems that could support different types of networks or use cases. Following this, in May 2021, ISED published the <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/spectrum-allocation/3650-4200-mhz/decision-technical-and-policy-framework-3650-4200-mhz-band-and-changes-frequency-allocation-3500"><cite>Decision on the Technical and Policy Framework for the 3650-4200 MHz Band and Changes to the Frequency Allocation of the 3500-3650 MHz Band</cite></a>. In this policy framework, ISED designated the 3900-3980 MHz band for shared usage to leverage the emerging equipment ecosystems for 5G technology and provide opportunities for users including wireless Internet service providers (WISPs), utilities, and industry verticals.</p>

<p>Note that licensees can deploy 5G or other wireless technologies as long as ISED's technical standards are met (i.e. SRSP-521, <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/devices-and-equipment/standard-radio-system-plans/srsp-521"><cite>Technical Requirements for Non-Competitive Local Licensed Services, including Fixed and/or Mobile Systems, and Flexible Use Broadband Systems, in the Band 3900-3980 MHz</cite></a>, RSS-198, <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/devices-and-equipment/radio-equipment-standards/flexible-use-broadband-equipment-operating-band-3900-3980-mhz"><cite>Flexible Use Broadband Equipment Operating in the Band 3900-3980 MHz</cite></a>).</p>

<h2 class="h3">How are the licence fees calculated?</h2>
</summary>

<p>A <a href="#tab2-content-Licencefeecalculator" onclick="openTabAndScroll('tab2-content-Licencefeecalculator', 'tab2-content-Licencefeecalculator'); return false;">licence fee calculator</a> is available to determine the total licence fee.</p>

<p>The annual licence fee for a non-competitive local licence is calculated by multiplying the base rate for the area type selected (metro and urban; rural or remote) multiplied by the total frequency blocks in MHz, multiplied by the area size in km<sup>2</sup>.</p>
</details>
</section>

<section>
<details><summary>
<h2 class="h3">How are fees calculated if an area overlaps two different area types?</h2>
</summary>

<p>If any portion of an NCL licence falls within a remote area, the fees are calculated using the <strong>remote</strong> base rate. Otherwise, if any portion of an NCL licence is located in a <strong>metro/urban</strong> area, then fees are calculated using the metro/urban base rate.</p>

<p>This table below shows which area type is used to determine the applicable base rate in case of overlap. Commonly referred to as the “Fee zone”.</p>

<h2 id="Application Process">Application process</h2>

<section>
<details><summary>
<h2 class="h3">How long does it take to obtain a licence?</h2>
</summary>

<p>Our service commitment is to provide your NCL licence within 12 weeks.</p>

<p>This commitment is contingent on the availability of the requested spectrum and the completeness of your application, with no errors.</p>
</details>
</section>

<section>
<details><summary>
<h2 class="h3">Why might an application be rejected?</h2>
</summary>

<p>An NCL licence application may be rejected if it does not conform to policy, technical or other requirements.</p>

<p>Some examples of reasons for an application being rejected include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the spectrum applied for is not available in the requested area</li>
	<li>the spectrum aggregation limit would be exceeded</li>
</ul>

<p>In the 3900 MHz band, the spectrum aggregation limit is exceeded when a licensee has multiple overlapping licences that result in more than 20 MHz of a total bandwidth at any given location. For instance, if the applicant already holds licences for blocks A3 and A4 in a particular area and applies for block A6 in an area that fully or partially overlaps the existing licence area, the application would be rejected.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that if the same frequency block is shared between the overlapping licences, it is only counted once when calculating total spectrum usage. Therefore, if both the existing and proposed licences cover the same blocks, the spectrum aggregation limit would not be exceeded.</p>

<p>If an application is rejected, a detailed report will be sent to you via email.</p>
</details>

<section>
<details><summary>
<h2 class="h3">Are licences renewed automatically?</h2>
</summary>

<p>Yes, licences will be automatically renewed if all conditions of licence are met and the renewal invoice is paid in full. The system will send an email to the licensee if it detects an issue that may impact the renewal.</p>
</details>

<section>
<details><summary>
<h2 class="h3">Can I edit a submitted application?</h2>
</summary>

<p>No, it is not possible to edit a submitted application. You can withdraw an application even after you’ve received an invoice. In the <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-system/en/NCL">NCLL services page</a>, navigate to the NCLL portal, then find the application, and under the “Actions” menu select “Withdraw”.</p>

<section>
<details><summary>
<h2 class="h3">Can I edit a licence?</h2>
</summary>

<p>No, it is not possible to edit a licence. If you wish to acquire a licence that covers the same area as another licence that you already hold, but with a different technical configuration, then you have two options available to you:</p>

<ol>
	<li>apply for an overlapping licence while retaining your original licence</li>
	<li>cancel your original licence by clicking "Cancel licence" under "Actions" in the portal, and apply for a new licence in the same area</li>
</ol>

<p>The below table lists the advantages and disadvantages for each option applied to 3900 MHz band.</p>

<h2 class="h3">What is the maximum licence area permitted in the 3900 MHz band?</h2>
</summary>

<p>The maximum area size per licence is as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>low power: 15 km<sup>2</sup></li>
	<li>medium power: 165 km<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>There is no limit on the number of licences a licensee may hold. For example, to cover an area of 45 km<sup>2</sup>, an applicant could apply for three low power licences with each licence covering 15 km<sup>2</sup> and must deploy at least one low power base station in each licence area. As a second example, to cover an area of 200 km<sup>2</sup>, an applicant could apply for multiple low power licences or multiple medium power licences or a combination of low power and/or medium power licences, depending on the use case and power requirements.</p>
</details>
</section>

<section>
<details><summary>
<h2 class="h3">Can I apply for the full 3900-3980 MHz band?</h2>
</summary>

<p>No. In the 3900 MHz band, ISED has implemented a limit of 20 MHz of spectrum that a licensee can acquire in any given geographic area.</p>

<p>As well, ISED expects that there will be significant demand for this band and that it may take some smaller mobile operators as well as non-traditional users time to develop their business cases for using the spectrum. Given this, ISED is reserving the 3940 MHz to 3980 MHz portion of the 3900 MHz band for small operators including small commercial mobile service providers, non-traditional users, and WISPs.</p>

<p>NCLL is currently available in the 3900 MHz band (3900 to 3980 MHz). It is comprised of 10 MHz frequency blocks (A1 through A8). In a single application, you can request either one 10 MHz block or two neighbouring (contiguous) blocks up to 20 MHz.</p>

<p>If you want two frequency blocks that aren’t contiguous (e.g. A2 and A4), then you must submit two separate applications.</p>

<p>You can request to have a specific frequency block or have us automatically select one for you. Note that large mobile service providers are not eligible to apply for blocks A5-A8 (i.e. 3940-3980 MHz).</p>

<p><cite>Determine your licence duration</cite></p>

<p>You have a choice of requesting a renewable or temporary licence.</p>

<p><strong>Renewable:</strong> Expires each year on March 31 with the option to renew.<br />
<strong>Temporary:</strong> Can be from 1 day to 11 months.<br />
<br />
You can apply for a licence 90 days in advance of the start date.</p>

<p><cite>Determine your licence area</cite></p>

<p>Identify the location you wish to licence. You can use the NCLL spectrum browser tool on the NCLL services page to draw your area and acquire a list of coordinates in WKT format. Alternatively, the application form also allows you to enter a list of coordinates or to draw your licence area directly on an interactive map. A maximum of 12 points is allowed.</p>

<p>For a low-power licence your licence area can be up to 15 km², and for a medium-power licence your licence area can be between 75 and 165 km². Note that within two years, you will need to deploy one station in your licence area.</p>

<p>If you require a larger area, you can apply for multiple adjacent licences. We provide a “duplicate licence” feature to make this straightforward. There is no limit to the number of NCLL licences one licensee can hold.</p>

<p>The following checklist is designed to help licensees stay compliant with ISED’s regulatory requirements and stay informed about those of other relevant departments and organizations.</p>

<p>Please note that this checklist does not supersede the conditions of licence, for which please see <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/licences-and-certificates/conditions-licence-appendices/r3-spectrum-licences-issued-non-competitive-local-licensing-band-3900-3980-mhz">R3 – Spectrum Licences issued via Non-Competitive Local Licensing in the Band 3900-3980 MHz.</a></p>

<h2 class="h3">Upload your site data information</h2>
</summary>

<p>You must start uploading site data one month after the licence is issued and continue doing so on a monthly basis.</p>

<ul>
	<li>please reference <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/learn-more/key-documents/procedures/client-procedures-circulars-cpc/cpc-2-1-30-technical-information-associated-radiocommunication-installations">CPC-2-1-30 - Technical Information Associated with Radiocommunication Installations</a> for information on the requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>If no station has been deployed yet, use “NOSTATIONS” upload</p>

<ul>
	<li>to do so, complete the spreadsheet up to column E and place “NOSTATIONS” in the Station Location column (Column F) of the file to be uploaded.</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is no change to your site data since the last upload, use “NOCHANGE” upload</p>

<ul>
	<li>to do so, complete the spreadsheet up to Column E and place “NOCHANGE” in the Station Location column (Column F) of the file to be uploaded. Doing this indicates that those stations continue to be in operation and that the data on file remains current.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>You must deploy at least one station and begin operating your network within two years of the licence’s effective date, ensuring continuous service delivery.</p>

<p>Once your network is active, you will need to demonstrate to ISED that you are providing service across your licence area on an ongoing basis by uploading your site data monthly. See the previous section for more details.</p>

<p>As a condition of your licence, you are not permitted to transmit outside of your licence area.</p>

<p>See section 11 of <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/licences-and-certificates/conditions-licence-appendices/r3-spectrum-licences-issued-non-competitive-local-licensing-band-3900-3980-mhz#:~:text=11.%20Deployment%20requirements">R3 — Spectrum Licences issued via Non-Competitive Local Licensing in the Band 3900-3980 MHz</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 class="h3">Follow the antenna tower siting procedure</h2>
</summary>

<p>If you are installing or modifying an antenna system, you must comply with ISED’s <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/learn-more/key-documents/procedures/client-procedures-circulars-cpc/cpc-2-0-03-radiocommunication-and-broadcasting-antenna-systems">Antenna Tower Siting Procedures</a> (CPC-2-0-03), which includes ensuring compliance with limits on radio frequency emissions (see Comply with Safety Code 6).</p>

<p>Before proposing a new antenna-supporting structure, licensees must investigate sharing or using existing infrastructure.</p>

<p>If a licensee plans to install a new antenna system or modify an existing antenna system not specifically exempt under <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/learn-more/key-documents/procedures/client-procedures-circulars-cpc/cpc-2-0-03-radiocommunication-and-broadcasting-antenna-systems#s6">Section 6 of CPC-2-0-03</a>, they must adhere the applicable land-use authority requirements and engage in the public consultation process.</p>

<p>All licensees must satisfy the general requirements outlined in Section 7 of <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/learn-more/key-documents/procedures/client-procedures-circulars-cpc/cpc-2-0-03-radiocommunication-and-broadcasting-antenna-systems">CPC-2-0-03</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h3">Comply with cross-border requirements</h2>
</summary>

<p>Canada and the United States establish agreements or arrangements to enable equitable spectrum access by each country along the Canada/U.S. border. These agreements or arrangements could result specific technical requirements for certain frequency bands. Negotiations between ISED and the FCC are currently underway regarding the 3900 MHz band, and any associated technical requirements (also known as cross-border requirements).NCL licensees are required to comply with any resulting cross-border requirements that ISED implements. Until the cross-border requirements are finalized, NCL licensees are required to comply with the interim measures currently prescribed in section 10 of <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/devices-and-equipment/standard-radio-system-plans/srsp-521">SRSP-521 – Technical Requirements for Non-Competitive Local Licensed Services, including Fixed and/or Mobile Systems, and Flexible Use Broadband Systems, in the Band 3900-3980 MHz</a>.</p>

<p>It is recommended that NCL licensees review the 3900 MHz <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/node/2315" target="blank"> Cross-Border Best Practices document</a>. This document provides guidance to help NCL licensees evaluate their potential compliance with the cross-border requirements. However, it does not constitute a comprehensive guideline for network design or station deployment and should not be interpreted as such. As well, this guide is not intended to eliminate all possibilities of interference.</p>

<section>
<details><summary>
<h2 class="h3">Follow the deployment requirements</h2>
</summary>

<p>You must deploy at least one station within 2 years of effective date of licence and start using your network to continuously provide services.</p>

<p>Once your network is operational, you must demonstrate ongoing service delivery across your licenced area updated site data to ISED on a monthly basis. Refer to the previous section for more details.</p>

<p>As a condition of your licence, you are not permitted to transmit outside of your licence area. </p>

<p>See section 11 of <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/licences-and-certificates/conditions-licence-appendices/r3-spectrum-licences-issued-non-competitive-local-licensing-band-3900-3980-mhz#:~:text=11.%20Deployment%20requirements">R3 — Spectrum Licences issued via Non-Competitive Local Licensing in the Band 3900-3980 MHz</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 class="h3">Obtain a Mobile Network Code (MNC)</h2>
</summary>

<p>If you operate equipment that requires an International Mobile Subscription Identity (IMSI) such as LTE or 5G systems, you may qualify for a Canadian-administered Mobile Network Code (MNC) assigned by the <a href="https://cnac.ca/index.htm">Canadian Numbering Administration Consortium (CNAC)</a>. A Canadian-administered MNC can be used with Canada’s Mobile Country Code (302).</p>

<p>To determine your eligibility, refer to section 7 of the Canadian International Mobile Network Code Assignment Guideline, found on <a href="https://crtc.gc.ca/cisc/eng/cisf3fg.htm">Canadian Steering Committee on Numbering: Guidelines and Numbering Links</a> to see if you qualify for a Canadian MNC. </p>

<p>If you plan to operate a private network and don’t qualify for a Canadian-administered MNC, you can consider using Mobile Country Code (MCC) 999, which is a globally shared country code for private networks. With this country code, you can use an MNC of your choice. For more information, visit <a href="https://www.itu.int/itu-t/recommendations/rec.aspx?rec=E.212">Appendix III to Recommendation ITU-T E.212 (06/2024)</a>.</p>
