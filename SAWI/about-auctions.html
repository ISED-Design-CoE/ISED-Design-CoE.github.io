            Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) manages
            spectrum to maximize economic and social benefits for Canadians.
            Auctions are a competitive licensing process generally used to award
            spectrum licences when the demand for spectrum is expected to exceed
            supply.

        <p>
          Through a structured process involving stakeholder consultation,
          competitive bidding, and regulatory oversight, these auctions enable
          efficient distribution of limited spectrum to service providers while
          maximizing public benefit and fostering innovation in wireless
          communications.

          The following is a summary of the auction process as described in the
          <a href="#" class="wrong-way">
            Framework for spectrum auctions in Canada</a
          >.

              <p>
                Auctions release or reallocate significant amounts of spectrum
                for commercial use, typically across the country. Before an
                auction begins, a public consultation process takes place to
                determine its attributes and design, such as the exact frequency
                ranges to be auctioned, the number and size of frequency blocks,
                reserve prices, and measures to support competition. Once an
                auction begins, it can take several weeks of bidding before it
                concludes. Spectrum auctions follow the approach described in
                the
                <a href="#">Framework for Spectrum Auctions in Canada</a> and
                generally take place according to the steps below.
              </p>
              <h3>
                1. Consultations on the proposed policy and licensing procedures
              </h3>
              <p>
                A formal consultation paper is published proposing all aspects
                of the upcoming auction. This document outlines the proposed
                spectrum policy, auction design, and licensing procedures and
                rules. The consultation process provides interested stakeholders
                with the opportunity to review and comment on these proposals
                before the auction framework is finalized.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Comment period</h3>
              <p>
                During this time, interested parties can submit written comments
                on the proposed auction design and rules. All stakeholders
                including potential bidders, industry associations and public
                interest groups may participate. After the closing date for
                receipt of comments, copies of all the comments received are
                posted on ISED’s website.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Reply comment period</h3>
              <p>
                During this time, stakeholders can respond to comments submitted
                during the initial comment period. This provides an opportunity
                for addressing concerns or refining proposals based on feedback.
                After the closing date for receipt of reply comments, copies of
                all the reply comments received are posted on ISED’s website.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Publication of the licensing framework/decision</h3>
              <p>
                After all submitted feedback has been reviewed, the final
                auction framework is published. This document discusses the
                comments received from the consultation process and describes
                the auction format, bidding rules and licence conditions. A
                table of key dates associated with the auction accompanies this
                document.
              </p>

              <h3>5. Clarification questions</h3>
              <p>
                Stakeholders have an opportunity to submit written questions
                asking for clarification of rules or policies related to the
                auction. Questions received by the deadline and ISED’s written
                answers to these questions are published online.
              </p>

              <h3>6. Deadline for the receipt of applications</h3>
              <p>
                Prospective participants must submit their completed application
                forms, supporting documentation and financial deposit by the
                published deadline. The specific application requirements are
                detailed in the auction framework.
              </p>

              <h3>7. Publication of the list of applicants</h3>
              <p>
                Shortly after the application submission deadline, ISED
                publishes online a comprehensive list of all applicants, as well
                as information about their beneficial ownership, affiliations
                and associations. This step does not imply that participants
                have been qualified to participate in the auction.
              </p>

              <h3>8. Publication of the list of qualified bidders</h3>
              <p>
                ISED publishes the official list of qualified bidders on its
                website. After this time, bidders receive training materials and
                a schedule for the first week of the auction.
              </p>

              <h3>9. Bidder information sessions and mock auctions</h3>
              <p>
                Qualified bidders receive training and become familiar with the
                auction rules, software platform and bidding procedures. Bidders
                participate in practice sessions on the actual auction software
                so they may identify and resolve any technical issues before the
                start of the auction.
              </p>

              <h3>10. Start of auction</h3>
              <p>
                The auction starts on the date specified in the auction’s table
                of key dates.
              </p>

              <h3>11. Conclusion of auction</h3>
              <p>
                The duration and conclusion of an auction depend on its design
                and format as well as bidding activity. Details on the closure
                of an auction are provided in the framework.
              </p>

              <h3>12. Publication of provisional licence winners</h3>
              <p>
                Shortly after the conclusion of the auction, the provisional
                results, including provisional winning bidders, prices and their
                licences are published online. Results are not considered final
                until all payments have been received.
              </p>

              <h3>13. Initial payment deadline</h3>
              <p>
                Provisional winners must submit their first payment by the
                published deadline. Failure to do so may result in forfeiture of
                licences won.
              </p>

              <h3>14. Final payment deadline</h3>
              <p>
                Provisional winners must submit their final payment (balance
                owing) by the published deadline. Failure to do so may result in
                forfeiture of licences won.
              </p>

              <h3>15. Issuance of licences</h3>
              <p>
                Once provisional winning bidders have submitted all payments on
                the final payment deadline, their licences are issued. At this
                time, all auction results are deemed final.
              </p>
              <h3>16. Publication of bidding data</h3>
              <p>
                A few months after issuing licences, ISED publishes on its
                website detailed bidding data, which includes bidders'
                identities and all bids submitted for the concluded auction.
                This is done in the interest of transparency of the auction
                process.
              </p>

            <details id="details-panel20" style="background-color: #ffffff">
              <summary>Residual auctions</summary>
              <p>
                Residual auctions are auctions of licences that remain
                unallocated at the conclusion of an auction, or of previously
                assigned licences that have been returned to ISED. Residual
                auctions follow the general approach described in the
                <a href="#" class="wrong-way"
                  >Streamlined Framework for Auctioning Residual Spectrum
                  Licences</a
                >, and generally do not require a consultation process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The process for residual auctions by sealed bid generally
                includes the steps below.
              </p>

              <h3>1. Publication of notice/decision</h3>
              <p>
                A formal notice is published announcing an upcoming auction of
                residual licences. The notice details the auction format and
                bidding rules (generally a sealed-bid auction with a
                second-price rule). A table of key dates associated with the
                residual auction accompanies this document.
              </p>
              <h3>2. Clarification questions</h3>
              <p>
                Stakeholders have an opportunity to submit written questions
                asking for clarification of rules related to the residual
                auction. Questions received by the deadline and ISED’s written
                answers to these questions are published online.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Deadline for the receipt of applications</h3>
              <p>
                Prospective participants must submit their completed application
                forms, supporting documentation and financial deposit by the
                published deadline. The specific application requirements are
                detailed in the residual auction notice.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Publication of the list of applicants</h3>
              <p>
                Shortly after the application submission deadline, ISED
                publishes online a comprehensive list of all applicants, as well
                as information about their beneficial ownership, affiliations
                and associations. This step does not imply that participants
                have been qualified to participate in the residual auction.
              </p>

              <h3>5. Publication of the list of qualified bidders</h3>
              <p>
                ISED publishes the official list of qualified bidders on its
                website. After this time, bidders receive an information
                package.
              </p>
              <h3>6. Start of residual auction (sealed bid deadline)</h3>
              <p>
                The deadline for receipt of sealed bids marks the start of the
                residual auction. This deadline is specified in the residual
                auction’s table of key dates.
              </p>
              <h3>7. Conclusion of residual auction</h3>
              <p>
                The conclusion of the residual auction depends on its design and
                format. It generally concludes within two weeks.
              </p>
              <h3>8. Publication of provisional licence winners</h3>
              <p>
                Shortly after the conclusion of the auction, the provisional
                results, including provisional winning bidders, prices and their
                licences, are published online. Results are not considered final
                until all payments have been received.
              </p>

              <h3>9. Initial payment deadline</h3>
              <p>
                Provisional winners must submit their first payment by the
                published deadline. Failure to do so may result in forfeiture of
                licences won.
              </p>

              <h3>10. Final payment deadline</h3>
              <p>
                Provisional winners must submit their final payment (balance
                owing) by the published deadline. Failure to do so may result in
                forfeiture of licences won.
              </p>
              <h3>11. Issuance of licences</h3>
              <p>
                Once provisional winning bidders have submitted all payments on
                the final payment deadline, their licences are issued. At this
                time, all residual auction results are deemed final.
              </p>
              <h3>12. Publishing bidding data</h3>
              <p>
                A few months after issuing licences, ISED publishes on its
                website detailed bidding data, which includes bidders'
                identities and all bids submitted for the concluded residual
                auction. This is done in the interest of transparency of the
                auction process.

            <summary><h3>Clock auction (CA) format</h3></summary>
            <p>
              The clock auction format is a bidding process that includes two
              stages: a clock stage and an assignment stage.<br /><br />
              The clock stage determines the number of generic blocks that a
              bidder will win and the price for these blocks. The assignment
              stage determines the specific frequencies that will be assigned to
              each winning bidder and the additional price for the specific
              frequencies.<br /><br />
              As an example, this format is detailed in section 10 and annexes D
              and E of the

              <h3>Combinatorial clock auction (CCA) format</h3>
            </summary>
            <p>
              The combinatorial clock auction format is a bidding process that
              allows bidders to bid on packages of licences instead of
              individual licences, eliminating the risk that bidders may win
              some but not all of the licences that they desire.<br /><br />
              The CCA includes a clock stage and an assignment stage. In the
              clock stage, there is a supplementary round allowing bidders the
              flexibility to submit additional packages of interest that they
              were unable to express during the clock rounds. All bids during
              the clock and supplementary rounds are binding and are used in
              determining the winners and the prices to be paid.<br /><br />As
              an example, this format is detailed in section 7 and annex C of
              the
              <a

                Simultaneous multiple-round ascending auction (SMRA) format
              </h3>
            </summary>

            <p>
              With this bidding process, specific licences (which include
              service areas and frequencies) are offered simultaneously in a
              single stage. Bidding is organized into a series of rounds, and
              information on the bids placed by all bidders is made available
              after each round. ISED sets the bid increments and bidders simply
              opt in or out of bidding.<br /><br />
              As an example, this format is detailed in section 6 and appendix B
              of the
              <a

            </summary>

            <p>
              This format is generally used for residual auctions. In a
              sealed-bid auction, bidders simultaneously submit sealed bids on
              the licence(s) they are interested in so that no bidder knows the
              bids of any other participant. <br /><br />As an example, this
              format is detailed in section 8 of the
