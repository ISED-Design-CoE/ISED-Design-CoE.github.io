            Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) manages
            spectrum to maximize economic and social benefits for Canadians.
            Auctions are a competitive licensing process generally used to award
            spectrum licences when the demand for spectrum is expected to exceed
            supply.

        <p>
          Through a structured process involving stakeholder consultation,
          competitive bidding, and regulatory oversight, these auctions enable
          efficient distribution of limited spectrum to service providers while
          maximizing public benefit and fostering innovation in wireless
          communications.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following is a summary of the auction process as described in the
          <a href="#" class="wrong-way">
            Framework for spectrum auctions in Canada</a
          >.

              <p>
                Auctions release or reallocate significant amounts of spectrum
                for commercial use, typically across the country. Before an
                auction begins, a public consultation process takes place to
                determine its attributes and design, such as the exact frequency
                ranges to be auctioned, the number and size of frequency blocks,
                reserve prices, and measures to support competition. Once an
                auction begins, it can take several weeks of bidding before it
                concludes. Spectrum auctions follow the approach described in
                the
                <a href="#">Framework for Spectrum Auctions in Canada</a> and
                generally take place according to the steps below.
              </p>
              <h3>
                1. Consultations on the proposed policy and licensing procedures
              </h3>
              <p>
                A formal consultation paper is published proposing all aspects
                of the upcoming auction. This document outlines the proposed
                spectrum policy, auction design, and licensing procedures and
                rules. The consultation process provides interested stakeholders
                with the opportunity to review and comment on these proposals
                before the auction framework is finalized.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Comment period</h3>
              <p>
                During this time, interested parties can submit written comments
                on the proposed auction design and rules. All stakeholders
                including potential bidders, industry associations and public
                interest groups may participate. After the closing date for
                receipt of comments, copies of all the comments received are
                posted on ISED’s website.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Reply comment period</h3>
              <p>
                During this time, stakeholders can respond to comments submitted
                during the initial comment period. This provides an opportunity
                for addressing concerns or refining proposals based on feedback.
                After the closing date for receipt of reply comments, copies of
                all the reply comments received are posted on ISED’s website.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Publication of the licensing framework/decision</h3>
              <p>
                After all submitted feedback has been reviewed, the final
                auction framework is published. This document discusses the
                comments received from the consultation process and describes
                the auction format, bidding rules and licence conditions. A
                table of key dates associated with the auction accompanies this
                document.
              </p>

              <h3>5. Clarification questions</h3>
              <p>
                Stakeholders have an opportunity to submit written questions
                asking for clarification of rules or policies related to the
                auction. Questions received by the deadline and ISED’s written
                answers to these questions are published online.
              </p>

              <h3>6. Deadline for the receipt of applications</h3>
              <p>
                Prospective participants must submit their completed application
                forms, supporting documentation and financial deposit by the
                published deadline. The specific application requirements are
                detailed in the auction framework.
              </p>

              <h3>7. Publication of the list of applicants</h3>
              <p>
                Shortly after the application submission deadline, ISED
                publishes online a comprehensive list of all applicants, as well
                as information about their beneficial ownership, affiliations
                and associations. This step does not imply that participants
                have been qualified to participate in the auction.
              </p>

              <h3>8. Publication of the list of qualified bidders</h3>
              <p>
                ISED publishes the official list of qualified bidders on its
                website. After this time, bidders receive training materials and
                a schedule for the first week of the auction.
              </p>

              <h3>9. Bidder information sessions and mock auctions</h3>
              <p>
                Qualified bidders receive training and become familiar with the
                auction rules, software platform and bidding procedures. Bidders
                participate in practice sessions on the actual auction software
                so they may identify and resolve any technical issues before the
                start of the auction.
              </p>

              <h3>10. Start of auction</h3>
              <p>
                The auction starts on the date specified in the auction’s table
                of key dates.
              </p>

              <h3>11. Conclusion of auction</h3>
              <p>
                The duration and conclusion of an auction depend on its design
                and format as well as bidding activity. Details on the closure
                of an auction are provided in the framework.
              </p>

              <h3>12. Publication of provisional licence winners</h3>
              <p>
                Shortly after the conclusion of the auction, the provisional
                results, including provisional winning bidders, prices and their
                licences are published online. Results are not considered final
                until all payments have been received.
              </p>

              <h3>13. Initial payment deadline</h3>
              <p>
                Provisional winners must submit their first payment by the
                published deadline. Failure to do so may result in forfeiture of
                licences won.
              </p>

              <h3>14. Final payment deadline</h3>
              <p>
                Provisional winners must submit their final payment (balance
                owing) by the published deadline. Failure to do so may result in
                forfeiture of licences won.
              </p>

              <h3>15. Issuance of licences</h3>
              <p>
                Once provisional winning bidders have submitted all payments on
                the final payment deadline, their licences are issued. At this
                time, all auction results are deemed final.
              </p>
              <h3>16. Publication of bidding data</h3>
              <p>
                A few months after issuing licences, ISED publishes on its
                website detailed bidding data, which includes bidders'
                identities and all bids submitted for the concluded auction.
                This is done in the interest of transparency of the auction
                process.
              </p>

            <details id="details-panel20" style="background-color: #ffffff">
              <summary>Residual auctions</summary>
              <p>
                Residual auctions are auctions of licences that remain
                unallocated at the conclusion of an auction, or of previously
                assigned licences that have been returned to ISED. Residual
                auctions follow the general approach described in the
                <a href="#" class="wrong-way"
                  >Streamlined Framework for Auctioning Residual Spectrum
                  Licences</a
                >, and generally do not require a consultation process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The process for residual auctions by sealed bid generally
                includes the following steps:
              </p>

              <h3>1. Publication of notice/decision</h3>
              <h3>2. Deadline for the receipt of applications</h3>
              <p>
                Submission period when prospective participants file their
                completed application forms with required documentation,
                including beneficial ownership information and financial
                deposits. The specific application requirements are detailed in
                the auction's consultation documents and the published licensing
                framework.
              </p>

              <h3>
                3. Publication of the list of applicants, beneficial ownership
                and affiliate associate information
              </h3>
              <p>
                Shortly after the application submission deadline, ISED
                publishes a comprehensive list of all applicants on its website.
                This disclosure includes information about beneficial ownership
                and affiliations between applicants, but does not indicate
                qualification status for auction participation.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Publication of the list of qualified bidders</h3>
              <p>
                ISED publishes the official list of qualified bidders on its
                website, specifying the licenses each bidder is eligible to bid
                on and their initial eligibility points for the auction.
              </p>

              <h3>5. Start of auction (sealed bid deadline)</h3>
              <h3>6. Conclusion of auction</h3>
              <h3>7. Publication of provisional licence winners</h3>
              <p>
                Official announcement of auction results, including disclosure
                of winning bidders, licenses won, and final prices, with a
                summary of the auction process.
              </p>

              <h3>8. Initial payment deadline</h3>
              <p>
                Date by which winners must submit their first payment
                installment, typically a percentage of the total winning bid
                amount. Failure to meet this deadline may result in forfeiture
                of winning bids.
              </p>

              <h3>9. Final payment deadline</h3>
              <p>
                Due date for payment of the balance of the winning bids, which
                must be payed before licenses can be issued.
              </p>

              <h3>10. Issuance of licences</h3>
              <p>
                Formal granting of licenses to winning bidders who have
                fulfilled all payment obligations. This marks the conclusion of
                the auction process.
