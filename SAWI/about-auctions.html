            ISED manages spectrum to maximize economic and social benefits for
            Canadians. When the demand for spectrum is not expected to exceed
            the supply, ISED generally uses a first come, first served licensing
            process to award spectrum licences. When the demand for spectrum is
            expected to exceed supply, a competitive licensing process, such as
            an auction, is generally used.

          Through a structured process involving stakeholder consultation,
          competitive bidding, and regulatory oversight, these auctions enable
          efficient distribution of limited spectrum to service providers while
          maximizing public benefit and fostering innovation in wireless
          communications.

              <p>
                Auctions are also called major auctions, online auctions or band
                auctions. Before an auction begins, a public consultation
                process takes place to determine its attributes and design, such
                as the exact frequency ranges to be auctioned, the number and
                size of frequency blocks, and measures to support competition.
                Once an auction begins, it can take several weeks of bidding
                before it concludes. Auctions follow the general approach
                described in the Framework for Spectrum Auctions in Canada.
              </p>
              <h3>
                1. Consultations on the proposed policy and licensing procedures
              </h3>
              <p>
                A formal notice is published in the Canada Gazette announcing
                the availability of a consultation paper addressing all aspects
                of the upcoming auction. This document outlines the proposed
                spectrum policy, auction design, and licensing procedures and
                rules. The consultation process provides interested stakeholders
                with the opportunity to review and comment on these proposals
                before the auction framework is finalized.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Comment period</h3>
              <p>
                Formal timeframe during which interested parties can submit
                written comments on the proposed auction design and rules. All
                stakeholders including potential bidders, industry associations,
                and public interest groups may participate.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Reply comment period</h3>
              <p>
                Secondary period allowing stakeholders to respond to comments
                submitted during the initial comment period. This provides
                opportunity for addressing concerns or refining proposals based
                on feedback. The comments are later made available on the ISED
                website.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Publication of the licensing framework/decision</h3>
              <p>
                Release of the final auction rules, procedures, and licensing
                conditions. This document incorporates relevant feedback from
                the consultation process and includes detailed information on
                eligibility requirements, auction format, bidding rules, and
                post-auction obligations.
              </p>

              <h3>5. Deadline for the receipt of applications</h3>
              <p>
                Submission period when prospective participants file their
                completed application forms with required documentation,
                including beneficial ownership information and financial
                deposits. The specific application requirements are detailed in
                the auction's consultation documents and the published licensing
                framework.

                and affiliate associate information

              <p>
                Shortly after the application submission deadline, ISED
                publishes a comprehensive list of all applicants on its website.
                This disclosure includes information about beneficial ownership
                and affiliations between applicants, but does not indicate
                qualification status for auction participation.
              </p>

              <h3>7. Publication of the list of qualified bidders</h3>
              <p>
                ISED publishes the official list of qualified bidders on its
                website, specifying the licenses each bidder is eligible to bid
                on and their initial eligibility points for the auction.
              </p>

              <h3>8. Bidder information sessions</h3>
              <p>
                Educational sessions for qualified bidders providing detailed
                explanation of auction rules, software platforms, and bidding
                procedures, with opportunity for bidders to ask questions about
                the auction process.
              </p>

              <h3>9. Bidder mock auctions</h3>

                **Will need to confirm this paragraph** Practice auction
                sessions using the actual auction software to allow bidders to
                become familiar with the bidding interface and auction dynamics,

                actual auction.
