      <h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">Residual auctions process</h1>
      <p>
        The process for residual auctions by sealed bid generally includes the
        following steps:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Publication of notice/decision</h3>
      <h3>2. Deadline for the receipt of applications</h3>
      <p>
        Submission period when prospective participants file their completed
        application forms with required documentation, including beneficial
        ownership information and financial deposits. The specific application
        requirements are detailed in the auction's consultation documents and
        the published licensing framework.
      </p>

      <h3>
        3. Publication of the list of applicants, beneficial ownership and
        affiliate associate information
      </h3>
      <p>
        Shortly after the application submission deadline, ISED publishes a
        comprehensive list of all applicants on its website. This disclosure
        includes information about beneficial ownership and affiliations between
        applicants, but does not indicate qualification status for auction
        participation.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Publication of the list of qualified bidders</h3>
      <p>
        ISED publishes the official list of qualified bidders on its website,
        specifying the licenses each bidder is eligible to bid on and their
        initial eligibility points for the auction.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Start of auction (sealed bid deadline)</h3>
      <h3>6. Conclusion of auction</h3>
      <h3>7. Publication of provisional licence winners</h3>
      <p>
        Official announcement of auction results, including disclosure of
        winning bidders, licenses won, and final prices, with a summary of the
        auction process.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Initial payment deadline</h3>
      <p>
        Date by which winners must submit their first payment installment,
        typically a percentage of the total winning bid amount. Failure to meet
        this deadline may result in forfeiture of winning bids.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Final payment deadline</h3>
      <p>
        Due date for the remaining balance of winning bids, which may occur in
        multiple stages for high-value auctions and must be completed before
        licenses can be issued.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Issuance of licences</h3>
      <p>
        Formal granting of licenses to winning bidders who have fulfilled all
        payment obligations. This marks the conclusion of the auction process.
      </p>
