      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Clock Auctions (CA) and Combinatorial Clock Auctions (CCA) are
        structured, multi-stage bidding processes designed to efficiently
        allocate resources such as spectrum licenses. The following outlines the
        complete auction process from initial consultation to license issuance.
      </p>

      <!-- <h3>On this page:</h3>

      </ul> -->

      <h3>1. Consultations on the Proposed Policy and Licensing Procedures</h3>
      <p>
        A formal notice is published in the Canada Gazette announcing the
        availability of a consultation paper addressing all aspects of the
        upcoming auction. This document outlines the proposed spectrum policy,
        auction design, and licensing procedures and rules. The consultation
        process provides interested stakeholders with the opportunity to review
        and comment on these proposals before the auction framework is
        finalized.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Comment period</h3>
      <p>
        Formal timeframe during which interested parties can submit written
        comments on the proposed auction design and rules. All stakeholders
        including potential bidders, industry associations, and public interest
        groups may participate.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Reply comment period</h3>
      <p>
        Secondary period allowing stakeholders to respond to comments submitted
        during the initial comment period. This provides opportunity for
        addressing concerns or refining proposals based on feedback. The
        comments are later made available on the ISED website.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Publication of the licensing framework/decision</h3>
      <p>
        Release of the final auction rules, procedures, and licensing
        conditions. This document incorporates relevant feedback from the
        consultation process and includes detailed information on eligibility
        requirements, auction format, bidding rules, and post-auction
        obligations.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Deadline for the receipt of applications</h3>
      <p>
        Submission period when prospective participants file their completed
        application forms with required documentation, including beneficial
        ownership information and financial deposits. The specific application
        requirements are detailed in the auction's consultation documents and
        the published licensing framework.
      </p>

      <h3>
        6. Publication of the list of applicants, beneficial ownership and
        affiliate associate information
      </h3>
      <p>
        Shortly after the application submission deadline, ISED publishes a
        comprehensive list of all applicants on its website. This disclosure
        includes information about beneficial ownership and affiliations between
        applicants, but does not indicate qualification status for auction
        participation.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Publication of the list of qualified bidders</h3>
      <p>
        ISED publishes the official list of qualified bidders on its website,
        specifying the licenses each bidder is eligible to bid on and their
        initial eligibility points for the auction.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Bidder information sessions</h3>
      <p>
        Educational session for qualified bidders providing detailed explanation
        of auction rules, software platforms, and bidding procedures, with
        opportunity for bidders to ask questions about the auction process.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Bidder mock auctions</h3>
      <p>
        **Will need to confirm this paragraph** Practice auction sessions using
        the actual auction software to allow bidders to become familiar with the
        bidding interface and auction dynamics, helping identify and resolve any
        technical issues before the actual auction.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Start of auction</h3>

      <h3>11. Conclusion of auction</h3>

      <h3>12. Publication of provisional licence winners</h3>
      <p>
        Official announcement of auction results, including disclosure of
        winning bidders, licenses won, and final prices, with a summary of the
        auction process.
      </p>

      <h3>13. Initial payment deadline</h3>
      <p>
        Date by which winners must submit their first payment installment,
        typically a percentage of the total winning bid amount. Failure to meet
        this deadline may result in forfeiture of winning bids.
      </p>

      <h3>14. Final payment deadline</h3>
      <p>
        Due date for the remaining balance of winning bids, which may occur in
        multiple stages for high-value auctions and must be completed before
        licenses can be issued.
      </p>

      <h3>15. Issuance of licences</h3>
      <p>
        Formal granting of licenses to winning bidders who have fulfilled all
        payment obligations. This marks the conclusion of the auction process.
