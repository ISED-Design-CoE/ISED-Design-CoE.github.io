            ISED manages spectrum to maximize economic and social benefits for
            Canadians. When the demand for spectrum is not expected to exceed
            the supply, ISED generally uses a first come, first served licensing
            process to award spectrum licences. When the demand for spectrum is
            expected to exceed supply, a competitive licensing process, such as
            an auction, is generally used.

        <h2 style="margin-top: 0%">How does a spectrum auction work?</h2>

        <p>
          Through a structured process involving stakeholder consultation,
          competitive bidding, and regulatory oversight, these auctions enable
          efficient distribution of limited spectrum to service providers while
          maximizing public benefit and fostering innovation in wireless
          communications.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following is a summary of the auction process as described in the
          <a
            href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/spectrum-allocation/framework-spectrum-auctions-canada"

            Framework for spectrum auctions in Canada</a
          >.
        </p>

        <section style="margin-left: 3%">
          <h3>1: Consultation</h3>
          <p>
            The spectrum auction consultation process involves publishing a
            notice in the Canada Gazette, collecting initial stakeholder
            comments over 45-90 days, and potentially allowing a second reply
            period where all feedback is publicly posted online.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section style="margin-left: 3%">
          <h3>2: Decision, framework and key dates</h3>
          <p>
            Following the consultation periods, the Minister of Industry
            publishes final policy decisions in the Canada Gazette, detailing
            licenses and rules, while allowing for clarification questions and
            amendments that are published online as official supplements to the
            policy.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section style="margin-left: 3%">
          <h3>3: Application</h3>
          <p>
            To participate in the auction, applicants must submit their
            applications following the
            <a
              href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/learn-more/key-documents/procedures/client-procedures-circulars-cpc/cpc-2-1-23-licensing-procedure-spectrum-licences-terrestrial-services#s5.12"
              >application requirements</a
            >
            with ownership details and deposits, after which ISED publishes
            lists of all applicants and later qualified bidders with their
            eligibility information. ISED will communicate with qualified
            bidders with information needed for the auction period.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section style="margin-left: 3%">
          <h3>4: Auction period</h3>
          <p>
            The auction process begins on predetermined dates specified in the
            <a href="/query?">table of key dates</a>, while the conclusion
            depends on the auction design and format rather than following a
            fixed schedule.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section style="margin-left: 3%">
          <h3>5: Post auction</h3>
          <p>
            Following the auction's close, provisional winners must submit
            documentation and make full payment for winning bids and penalties
            before receiving their licenses. Any unsold or forfeited licenses
            may be offered later through residual auctions or alternative
            processes such as first-come, first-served.
